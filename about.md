## The Plan/Goal

To be completely honest, there isn't a solid plan for this repo. As I pick up bits and pieces, I end up with snippets of code in random sandboxes, pens, bins, gists and in "experimental" branches of projects. It's difficult to look to some previous example when I need to refresh my memory when I'm not sure where or when I worked something out. So, I am creating a single place for the sample code and the notes I make for myself as I wrap my head around the pieces and as I start to figure out how to combine these ideas into more powerful code.

I don't have a planned path or format that I plan to adhere to. The path will be largely determined by which ADT, function or concept is sticking in my mind begging to be understood at that moment. The format for the repo is wide open now, but as content starts to accumulate, I'm sure some kind of pattern and structure will emerge naturally... or it'll be a giant mess that only I understand (I _hope_ to avoid this, but no promises)

I have a couple of separate but related goals for this repo.

1. My primary goal here is to learn via experimentation, repetition and through explaining my understanding through notes and comments in the code samples.
2. While I can't promise this will provide value to others, it would be nice if these samples and notes eventually helped somebody other than myself.
3. As the basis for future teaching. Having the notes I make for myself as I work through different problems should help me create videos and blog posts that are geared for people like myself who don't have a solid grasp of Monads, Monoids and other "heavy" topics in FP (**yet!**).
